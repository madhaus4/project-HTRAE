### Summary
For the fast paced user who is looking for a quick and reliable climate change refrence tool.  

When a user visits the project•HTRAE website, they first land on the home page which gives a breif explaination of the mission.  From there, the navigation bar offers a few pages to sift through.  The first three pages: 'CO2', 'Surface Temp', and 'Glacial Melt' all have graphs to help visualize data and give context to the statements on each page.  When a user clicks on the 'Sustainable tips' button in the nav, the page they are brought to generates tips for the user to incorporate into their daily life.  The sustainable tips page can either be refreshed to display a new pointer or the user can click the 'Another Tip' button.  The user has the ability to save and un-save lifestyle tips of their choosing.  Additionally, viewing their saved recommendations is an option as well.  The last page to check out is 'This Planet' page that offers some beautiful landscape images as a 'why' reminder to the mission.

### Current Features
- User has the ability to save and un-save lifestyle tips.
- Saved tips persist on page reload for better UX.
- Offers quick information on an expansive topic.
- Nice visuals, including graphs and overall UI.


### Future Features & Noteworthy Limitations
- Add more images to 'This Planet' page & when the user hovers an image, flip it so the user has some context for each image. 
- Add a few more pages on other natural gases that play a role in climate change, ex. Methane and Nitrous Oxide.
- Somehow add more places for the user to interact with the application.
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices.  The graphs are pretty tough to style to how they are but I'd love to make it more responsive for more users.
